## BackGround:
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a pivotal role in providing essential scientific data on natural hazards, environmental health, and the effects of climate change and land-use practices. USGS scientists continually innovate to deliver timely and pertinent information about Earth and its processes. Currently, USGS seeks to develop a set of tools for visualizing their extensive earthquake data, which they collect globally every day but currently lack a meaningful way to present. This initiative aims to enhance public awareness and inform government organizations while potentially securing increased funding for addressing pressing planetary issues.

### Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. Get your dataset,
    * Dataset resource is from <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php" target="_blank">USG GeoJSON Feed</a> 
2. Import and visualize the data
    * Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
    * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
    * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
